Some researches about wifi market of japan
First of all, I think in the japanese market hon hai is having a big percent of market.And huawei seems to want to sell his productions to japan.Also the newest componies like humax of korea is also occupying the japanese market.So it seems that if we have the suggestion of that the old companiez of japan is now been eaten by taiwan,china and jordan.
Even through the 50% petcent of the market is still been occupied by native companies of japan.So what can japanese do in the market of wifi routers.

Well, it seems that in a long time the outside sea forces will not eat the software of japan,but anyway now it is in a mass.We can not see the future is good or not.But it seems that even through we know the transaction of japan,we also have to know the technology of japan.

At last I suggest that seeing this trend we have to know how to communicate with people around.Essential risk is that if I lost the ability of hearing.
